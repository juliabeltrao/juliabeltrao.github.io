				<h3>Weekly debates</h3>
				<p><span class="image left">
				<script type="text/javascript">getRandomImage(random_images_array_debating,'images/debating/');</script>
				</span>
				The society hosts weekly debate practices in Töölö at KY House and in Otaniemi at Design
Factory. You will also find ADS members at the debates of the Helsinki University Debating
Society. <br>

<br>Weekly debate practices every Wednesday at KY House 18:30, Wednesdays in Töölö! <br>

<br>Bi-monthly debates every even numbered week at Design Factory 18:00, Tuesdays in Otaniemi! <br>

<br>Debate practices are a great way to try out British parliamentary debating as well as to
practice and improve one’s skills at argumentation. Practices are relaxed debates where
participants look to hone their skills and receive feedback from our more experienced
debaters.

				<h3>Workshops, show debates and guest speaker events</h3>
				<p><span class="image right">
				<script type="text/javascript">getRandomImage(random_images_array);</script>
				</span>
				The society organizes lots of events to promote debating and teach skills related to debating. These include: <br>
<b>Workshops</b> – Classes held by experienced debaters and judges for the honing of specific
skills related to debating. These are excellent opportunities to get coaching from top level
talent, and often attracts not just debaters, but plenty of Aalto Students looking to develop
themselves. We have been delighted to cooperate with corporations in these workshops, such
as Boston Consulting Group.<br>
<b>Show debates</b> – Public debates on subjects relating to current events or that are particularly
in the public’s interest to promote debating. These debates involve experienced debaters
from Aalto Debating Society and Helsinki Debating Society showing just what a debate is
like. The debates are usually started by an introduction to the topic given by a guest speaker,
or then by one of the society members. After the debates we invite the audience to ask
questions and participate in discussion. Inspiring interest in debating as well as discussion
around the subject is the goal of public debates.<br>
<b>Guest speaker events</b> - As a part of show debates or workshops we often have speakers,
sometimes visiting experts or professors, or then experienced debaters or judges from other
debating societies come present to our group.<br>
<b>Mini Tournaments</b> – A one day tournament for teams from nearby societies, usually
meaning Finland, but also Sweden or Estonia if they feel it to be close enough. These are a
great way to practice for upcoming tournaments for newcomers and experienced debaters
alike. Mini tournaments involve several debates and motions with judging, ranking and the
announcing of motions. They also have tabbing and the pairing up of teams according to
their points, just like at tournaments. However these tournaments do not have a break to 
finals, and in general are more casual than "full tournaments". Often there are awards for the
team to score the most points or for the best speakers.

				<h3>Tournaments</h3>
				<p><span class="image left">
				<script type="text/javascript">getRandomImage(random_images_array_tournaments,'images/tournaments/');</script>
				</span>
				Debating tournaments take place all around the world, usually hosted by the debating
				societies/clubs/unions of local Universities. These competitions allow you to test your
				debating mettle against debaters from all over the world. All of the society’s members have
				the chance to attend lots of tournaments, with tournaments for the experience and novice’s
				alike being on offer in Europe.
				Tournaments usually take place over a weekend, with days dedicated to debates and
				evenings to socials. They are a great chance to meet interesting people with different
				backgrounds and points of view. 
				</p>

				<h3>Socials</h3>
				<p><span class="image right">
				<script type="text/javascript">getRandomImage(random_images_array_socials,'images/socials/');</script>
				</span>
All work and no play makes for a dull day. Socials are a big part of debating tournaments and
likewise of the society. Debating is about more than just improving ones rhetorical skills, it
also involves meeting people from different countries and degree programs. Debaters tend to
form quick and lasting friendships through the society and at tournaments. We may be
biased, but in our experience debaters tend to be witty and interesting people worth
spending time with.
After weekly debate practices the participants go out for drinks together to socialize, discuss
and relax together after the evening’s verbal combat. The society also organizes dinners,
game nights, sauna evenings, debate or current affairs related TV or movie viewing nights
and plenty of other excuses for its members to come together to talk and have fun.
